    The statement is somewhat unclear to me. One thing is clearâ€”our target is the sum of all
    elements minus 1. If and only if we remove 1 from the array, it can be proven that
    there exists a subsequence. However, there could be multiple 1s and even several 0s.
    When it comes to 0s, there will be too many options, which leads to the 2^n formula. Nice!
